                <h2>What I do</h2>
                <p>
                    I help startups move from “we should use AI” to measurable business impact. 
                    Most teams either overbuild too early or ship demos that never translate into revenue. 
                    I focus on identifying the right use cases, validating product-market fit, and building scalable AI systems that support real growth.
                </p>

                <p>I design AI product systems that do three things:</p>
                <ol class="numbered-list">
                    <li>Identify high-value, defensible AI use cases tied directly to customer pain and business economics</li>
                    <li>Rapidly validate demand and usage signals before over-investing in engineering</li>
                    <li>Scale MVPs into production-grade systems with the right data, feedback loops, and governance</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    I treat use case discovery, PMF validation, and technical scaling as one connected system. 
                    When aligned, your AI becomes a durable advantage instead of a feature experiment.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    Example: An early-stage B2B SaaS company wanted to “add AI” to increase differentiation. 
                    Instead of building a generic assistant, we identified a workflow bottleneck costing customers hours per week. 
                    We prototyped a focused AI workflow tool, validated usage with 12 pilot customers, and shipped a narrow MVP. 
                    Within 90 days, activation increased 28% and expansion revenue improved across early cohorts.

                    I work with founders, CEOs, and product leaders at early and growth-stage startups building AI-native or AI-enabled products.

                    I’m most valuable when:
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>You have strong technical capability but unclear product direction</li>
                    <li>You’ve shipped an AI feature but don’t see sustained usage</li>
                    <li>You’re preparing for a fundraise and need a credible AI roadmap</li>
                    <li>You need structure around experimentation, evaluation, and iteration</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If your team is already investing in AI engineering, the leverage from disciplined product thinking is significant.

                    AI markets move quickly. Speed without clarity creates waste. 
                    Reach out if momentum feels high but outcomes feel uncertain.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Common signals:</strong></p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>You’re experimenting with multiple AI ideas but lack prioritization discipline.</li>
                    <li>Your MVP works technically but customers don’t engage deeply.</li>
                    <li>Model costs are rising without proportional revenue impact.</li>
                    <li>Product, engineering, and GTM are misaligned on what “AI success” means.</li>
                    <li>You’re unsure whether your differentiation is defensible or replicable.</li>

                    My work is hypothesis-driven, evidence-based, and execution-focused. 
                    I combine AI capability understanding with rigorous product discipline.

                    <li><strong>Diagnostic:</strong> Audit use cases, data readiness, customer workflows, and economics</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Identify 1–2 high-leverage AI opportunities tied to measurable outcomes</li>
                    <li><strong>MVP Design:</strong> Define narrow scope, success metrics, evaluation framework, and rollout plan</li>
                    <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Implement feedback loops, cost controls, observability, and roadmap sequencing</li>

                    I work alongside your team. I do not replace it. 
                    The goal is to leave you with durable systems, not dependency.
